#### Description of Source Data

##### The data was composed by using a data set from Kaggle which displayed varous different satistics for video games sales throughout the world, which is labeled as vgsales.csv.zip in the resources tab. This file was used as the base and then we needed to get all the metacritic data for those game titles. So we found a dataset on Kaggle for Metacritic data for a large set of video games. However, the Metacritic data for games we found on Kaggle did not have nearly as many game titles as our vgsales.csv.zip file, so we then created a scraping script based off the column names in the Metacritic ratings file from Kaggle to scrape the data from metacritic site manually for all the game titles in vgsales.csv.
