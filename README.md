# Group 05 Final Project

## Topic & Background (Maria Castellanos)

Video games have been around since the mid-1900s, but it was not until milestones such as the release of PacMan and Nintendo’s creation of Donkey Kong in 80s that the industry really started to boom. Through the eras of arcade gaming, the development of multiplayer games, and then to the creation of home gaming consoles -the population of global players has steadily continued to rise [1]. In 2020 alone, the gaming industry has yielded a total revenue of 159.3 billion -up 9.3% from 2019. It has also accounted for 2.7 billion players globally -up 5.3% from 2019. In fact, it is forecasted that the gaming market revenue will grow to $200.8 billion and the global player count will rise to 3.07 billion by 2023 [2]. 

## Purpose (Maria Castellanos)

With the increasing popularity and plethora of available games, our group will trend historical gaming data to analyze what makes a game successful. By doing so, it becomes possible to aid publishers and developers in releasing products aligned with current and future consumer interests.
