Sometimes it's also infuriating but in the end that too is mostly a good thing. Still, something should have been done to the power ups of old.

There's plenty here to make up for the disappointment of local multiplayer, but it does stop short of magnificence.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>88</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>The Wii's enormous 'casual' gamer base will eat Mario Kart Wii up with its accessible pick-up-and-play controls.

Besides a few niggles with unfair A.I. and some average tracks, this is a valuable addition to the series.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>85</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>The most solid, accessible and fun experience console gaming has seen in some time.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>85</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>When everything is taken together Mario Kart is definitely another must buy game for Nintendo’s innovative system.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>85</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Despite some minor flaws, Nintendo's latest take on their classic kart racing series is definitely worth checking out.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>85</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Mario Kart has been around for nearly every Nintendo system, with the Wii's version acting more like a 'Greatest Hits' compilation of past racing glory.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>85</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>This is the first case of Nintendo not finding a happy medium between accessibility and servicing hardcore players. Yet if you get a group of people together on a Saturday night to play you'll be the only one complaining.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>84</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>In the end, I'd have to give Nintendo a big pat on the back for this one.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>84</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>You'll assuredly have plenty of fun with this, even if Nintendo's play-it-safe, dumb-it-down approach will make many longtime players yearn for something more ambitious and risky.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>83</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>The weapons can get a little overwhelming and frustrating at times, especially when you’re in the lead (and the frankly unfair brutality of the 150cc-class rubber-banding, curse-evoking A.I.), but most of what’s in place, both old and new, still makes for a romping good time, locally or globally.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>83</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>The bright, shiny visuals—now available in 480p—and the slide-whistle sound effects will make depressives choke on their Zoloft doses.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>83</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Mario Kart Wii is a complete game. Of course, the addition of the online mode makes this title a keeper and a must have title for your Wii collection but for unconditional local multiplayer lovers, the offline mode has also received some upgrades and tweaks.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>83</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Then there is the Wii Wheel peripheral itself, which if you did not already know is just a plastic housing for the Wiimote. I have to admit though it is a well made bit of plastic, and is not only smarter looking than the uninspired Wii Zapper, but also more ergonomic to hold. Unexpectedly it is very easy to use.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Nintendo's draconian online service isn't a reason to dislike Mario Kart Wii in the same way that it's wrong to dislike a really beautiful woman because her husband is a complete tosser...As a Wii owner, we've got the definitive racing game on the console.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>An excellent return to form for the series and tremendous fun when played with friends in split-screen or online. The often infuriating Grand Prix mode is likely to polarise gamers though, with some loving the unpredictability of it while others will simply give up after being taken down at the last minute by yet another Spiny Blue Shell.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Previous control schemes have always worked well with Mario Kart, and you can still use variations on these by adjusting your options, but the new wheel just feels so intuitive you’ll be wondering why they bothered including them.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>We're treated to the same formula as we got the last time, with the major addition being the online mode. It’s not much, but since Mario Kart is all about playing together it's enough to make this an entertaining package.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>One thing Mario Kart Wii features a lot of is multiplayer options.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Mario Kart Wii is definitely up there with the other installments. A fairly limited single player appeal is enhanced by a comprehensive online service and a slightly toned-down but throughly enjoyable and flexible offline multiplayer mode.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Mario Kart Wii has many faults. But when it’s good, it’s very, very good, and as long as you have Wi-Fi, it will keep you occupied for many months to come.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Mario Kart Wii is a great new game in the series. It still plays like a dream and is perhaps the most enjoyable game of the last few years. Even the additions of motorcycles, Wii-Wheel and online mode are suprisingly good. Mario Kart Wii even does something which most other games lack: It brings fun.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Mario Kart Wii doesn't stray far from the beaten track, but it has enough going to dazzle first-time MK drivers and a few new upgrades to challenge the long-time Karters, too.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Newcomers will find a fast-paced, easy-to-play title that relishes in its own ability to capitalize on the wacky approachability and fun of Nintendo’s mascot characters.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>The overuse of power-ups is blatantly ridiculous and the general design hasn't changed much, but Kart is still a riotous romp.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>A must-own Wii racer that pays multiplayer dividends.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Between the local and online multiplayer, as well as the plethora of single-player challenges available, this is the kind of game that has a ton of replay value.

[Issue#22, p.60]</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>In spite of a few valid criticisms, Mario Kart Wii is a ton of fun, albeit being the same experience as always wrapped in a different package.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>At sixteen years young, Mario Kart has now made it to the Wii. Whilst fans of the series may lament some of the changes, it generally works well on the new platform. The focus has shifted away from a heavy skill requirement towards simply offering more entertainment.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Mario Kart Wii is exactly what you would expect from this franchise, a solid offer that doesn't offer anything new, yet still manages to retain its appeal. Especially if you manage to get a few friends together to play it or decide to give use to its solid online capabilities.</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>wii</td><td>80</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Ultimately, the sheer sensory pleasure of playing Mario Kart Wii - from the charming animations, to the bopping tunes, to the sugar-rush boosting, to the exquisite steering - far overcomes the few concerns we have about it.

If enough WMPs are sold, and enough developers pay attention, it may just work.</td><td>Wii Sports Resort</td><td>wii</td><td>70</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>The Wii Sports along this becomes almost a demo. The number of modes and games available is great. It is spectacular to put the capabilities of the Wii Motion Plus in test and improve the control of movements of the Wii, given that we have a fun game here.</td><td>Wii Sports Resort</td><td>wii</td><td>70</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Wii Sports Resort is a fantastic showpiece for MotionPlus, and the one thing that Gamestyle takes away from its time with the game is the possibility of what it could lead to.</td><td>Wii Sports Resort</td><td>wii</td><td>70</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Set of minigames takes full advantage of the enhanced abilities you get with the new Motion Plus controller.

If you already own a number of Wiimotes this will give you a really entertaining experience with friends and family. Most of the new minigames are really entertaining and the revamped ones have been greatly improved. The Wii Motion Plus does improve the overall feeling a lot, but since it remedies past shortcomings that's more of a necessity than a strength.

But boy can you have fun without worrying about morals.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Without question, the most involving, top-to-bottom, start-to-finish, out-of-body experience ever presented in a video game.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Theft Auto V is the best the series has ever been, and that’s a compliment that speaks volumes.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>GTA5 does much more than repeat the San Andreas model, introducing many new features in the franchise. From those, the one that adds a whole new dimension to the game is the fact that for the first time we have three main characters instead of one. GTA is the king of controversy... long live the king.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Theft Auto V is not just the best sandbox game there is. It's not just one of the best 3rd-person shooters ever. It's not just a great action game, a great driving game, and a great piloting or sports game. It's not just the biggest audiovisual spectacle in the last few years. Grand Theft Auto V is the best game in the current console generation, period.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>What genius. Rockstar Games are still at the top level of open world videogames and they want everybody to know it, especially the rival titles. They will need a lot of creativity and great ingenuity to take the crown from the grip of the king GTA 5. No matter what happens next, a video game has never reached such depth in its gameplay. Gunfights from Max Payne 3, the exploration system from Red Dead Redemption, the driving system from Midnight Club: simply the best from the best. Simply perfect.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>GTA V is in line with our expectations. It offers what we expected: a beautiful and gigantic world, hours and hours of play... but it does it better than ever. GTA V also adds the ability to switch between three different characters, which is really interesting and fun during hold-up sequences. This is a must-have, obviously.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Three incredible characters in a well-driven storyline, a ton of things to do and a ton of fun. GTA 5 is simply the best game of this generation.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>It is engaging, compelling, interesting, clever, funny and packed with things to do and see. It’s a personal story, or several personal stories, set in a magnificent world that ebbs and flows with thousands of people who all seem to be living their own personal stories. It’s a genuine landmark event in the history of videogames.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Pull out the clichés and superlatives, because they’re all applicable. GTA 5 is the ultimate milestone for the series, as well as for gaming as a whole. When it comes to scale, detail, character, freedom and spectacle this generation of consoles has reached its absolute peak. It doesn’t trump The Last of Us or BioShock: Infinite in the form of emotional impact, but there’s no other game out there that does this much this well.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>It's the best and the biggest sandbox ever made. The story and how it's told, the deep world around us where there's always something happening, and the amount of content and things to do, make it the perfect closure for this generation.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Part of what makes the game so generally appealing is that, for the most part, it drops the nagging feeling of “good for an open world game.'...Grand Theft Auto V is a good shooter and a good driving game with responsive character control. While some of the extras might be spread a little thin, there are no compromises with these central mechanics, which is a feat for a game of this breadth.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>If a picture is worth a thousand words then the game itself is a novel every city block and every dusty trail. It’s the million dollar fireworks display at the end of the current generation cycle of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 – handing out free beer and barbeque chicken wings.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>If anyone is still wondering if GTA has lost its ability to take on the politically correct about ‘appropriate’ content, do not fear, as it is full of violence, social commentary and explicit nature that is sure to aggravate someone with too much time on their hands.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>There’s simply more here than in any game before, and yet quality is never sacrificed for quantity. Personal favourites will persist, but it’s hard to put anything else on top of the pile. Everything you’ve ever wanted a GTA game to be, and a whole lot more. Consistently hilarious, constantly compelling and combining never-before-seen scale and ambition. This is going to make next-gen look bad for a long time to come.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Rockstar shows one more time how to build a masterpiece. GTA V is not perfect but has everything you'll ever dream in a sandbox game. San Andreas is gorgeous and full of life, Trevor, Michael and Franklin are a trio full of charisma and the game simply raises the bar in so many aspects you won't believe that it runs on an eight years old hardware. It's worth your money, it's worth you time.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>100</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>With a swan song to the aging console generation Rockstar once again shows us what Open World really means. The Developer takes a sandbox, blows it up to the size of a football field, fills it with the most beautiful sand and all the toys we really want to play with.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>99</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>GTA IV was extraordinarily good, but it took itself a little bit too seriously. GTA V outdoes even San Andreas when it comes to changing up standard shootouts with more wacky, explosive and memorable missions. [October 2013 p.56]</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>98</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Theft Auto V is the magnum opus of the current generation. It has an amazing game world filled with loads of content and the feeling that you can do literally anything you want. Add three fantastic main characters to it, with their flaws and virtues and you have the recipe for this magnificent game. Nothing less than a masterpiece. </td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>98</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Theft Auto V is nothing short of perfection. It has a bit of everything for everyone in terms of gameplay. A good story mixed with intense action sequences and a large scope to set all of it up in. If this was going to be the last big title from Rockstar on this generation, what a helluva way to go out.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>98</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Editing the GTA formula has been done with love and care. Playing with no less than three main characters works well in every thinkable way, and after finishing the compelling and sharply written story, there’s enough to do in the wide world of Los Santos and environment. GTA 5 simply offers an ambitious, successful experience of a rare quality level.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>98</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>San Andreas is vast and sprawling and so much fun to explore. There are thousands of things to do and hundreds of missions, so this will not be a quick playthrough.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>98</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Rockstar Games deserves credit for pushing the boundaries of its flagship franchise yet again with improved controls, great mission variety, and the most jam-packed open world I've ever visited.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>98</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Gigantic and stupidly detailed, GTA V is everything we hoped it would be. Individual components could be a touch better, but when a game does literally everything, nobody can expect perfection across the board. That it even comes close is incredible. [Issue#236, p.62]</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>97</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>An absolute masterpiece that you can't miss: this is a perfect sequel in the GTA series.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>97</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>The long-awaited fifth episode in Rockstar's extremely popular franchise delivers on all fronts.

What are you waiting for?</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>95</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Don't let the missing half-point fool you, Grand Theft Auto V is as good of a retail release you'll find this generation and an excellent coda to this generation for Rockstar.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>95</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Theft Auto V is a gargantuan accomplishment, with an emphasis on the word “gargantuan.” It may still have an assortment of inconsistencies, idiosyncrasies and eccentricities, but one could argue that such missteps still give this franchise a singular character.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>95</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Time just melted away as I lived a second, third, and fourth life in GTA V. The experience consists of more than just crimes. I played tennis, enrolled in a flight school, captured fugitives, watched movies, and towed cars. A lot of that doesn’t sound fun on paper, but they bring some semblance of real life to a world that otherwise runs on its own bizarre rules.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>95</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Whether you were burned by GTA 4 or not, GTA 5 remembers what the series is all about: emergent sandbox fun and a helluva a lot of murder. You need to play it.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>95</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>These characters are voice-acted so annoyingly well that you almost wish the character would never speak again, just like some of the main characters. The music and talk shows are also great to listen to as you are traveling around. All in all, the sound department is not lacking in GTA V.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>94</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Theft Auto V is a remarkable achievement. Fun, challenging, satisfying and morally complex, it’s also proof of the ability of games to tackle mature subjects while still being enjoyable diversions, all in service to great characters and a gritty story.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>93</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>All in all, Grand Theft Auto V is one of those majorly hyped titles that actually delivers.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>91</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>The best way to bid farewell to the retiring consoles is to spend dozens of hours having fun in Los Santos: robbing, abusing illegal substances, breaking all laws and enjoying everything else that GTA V has to offer. And after we finish the game, we should all say loudly: ‘okay, Rockstar girls and boys, it’s high time to make a truly new GTA, not just a gigantic DLC’. [12/2013, p.36]</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>90</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Rockstar put tons of time and effort into polishing its winning formula. It isn't a dramatic change for the series, but it's a more polished, and very enjoyable, addition to the franchise.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>90</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>A compelling culmination of exact care and attention, Grand Theft Auto V's obsessive attention to detail is matched only by its gripping mission design and clever caricature cast.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>90</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>If you’re absolutely opposed to torture, or you need a positive woman character in your game, Grand Theft Auto V is a complete non-starter...Despite my feelings about those things, however, I still found myself having fun outside of them. The rest of the game is good enough that I was up until 3:00 am one night playing mission after mission.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>90</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>GTA5 may not be the Hollywood-beating crime story it wants to be, then, but it's the best video game it's ever been, and I'll take that.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>90</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>GTA V is an imperfect yet astounding game that has great characters and an innovative and exciting narrative structure, even if the story it uses that structure to tell is hobbled at times by inconsistent character behavior, muddled political messages and rampant misogyny. It also raises the bar for open-world mission design in a big way and has one of the most beautiful, lively, diverse and stimulating worlds ever seen in a game.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>playstation-3</td><td>90</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Holy f***ing s***. (Sorry...I'm swearing a lot more now because of San Andreas.) I can't wrap my head around how much stuff is packed into this one disc. It's grand, it's ambitious, and funny as this may sound, it's legendary. [Dan Hsu]</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>It has such an enormous amount to offer (did I even mention the two player option?) and carries everything off with such confidence and style that it's hard to fault.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>It's not just the best Grand Theft Auto to date, it's possibly the best game you'll ever play on PlayStation 2. It's simply that good.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>A manifesto for every future video game. Now we've seen what can be done when truly brilliant people get to make a world brimming with variety, music, humour and sheer scale, very few other games are going to be able to live up to it.

It pops many caps in many asses. [Jan 2005, p.58]</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>So good that it even drew Axl Rose out of hiding (he’s the DJ on the classic rock station, one of 11 listening formats), San Andreas cranks out even more action than 'Vice City' as you engage in those wacky gang-related adventures you've grown to love in disconcertingly authentic versions of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Take a large measure of 'GTA III'; add a sprinkle of 'Vice City', freshly sliced sprigs of nineties gang culture; stir in dashes of 'Manhunt', 'Fable', and 'Dance-Dance Revolution' to taste, then mix in a nitro-powered-blender from hell. Result? Ten out of ten.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>It's like 5 games in one: part RPG, part adventure, part action, part racer and part sim. And it does it just as well as the best games in any of those genres...One of the best games ever released on any system.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Somehow, Rockstar keeps the same old ingredients, adds a handful of new ones, and manages to create a great new recipe.

The biggest game ever.

This is more than a game. This is entertainment at its best. [Dec 2004, p.170]</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>A masterpiece; the outstanding gameplay from the first two games has been extended, tweaked and applied to a fresh, original and fascinating setting. There's more than enough meat to keep you going for months, and the sheer variety of gameplay is bewildering.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Not only a masterpiece, it's the finest game currently available for the PS2. Buy it now, but don't make any plans for a couple months at least.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>A true platform defining title; in 20 years time gamers will look back at the Playstation2 and hold GTA: San Andreas as the true epoch-making title of the times. Nothing can be understated, RockStar North have truly delivered beyond everybody’s expectations.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>San Andreas is shocking, not necessarily because of its typically contentious subject matter (though there's plenty in it to rub those of a conservative disposition the wrong way) but because of the sheer scale of the experience...Is it really the best game ever made? Quite possibly, yes.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>The best game on the PS2.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>The graphical effects in this title are far superior to anything GTA conjured up previously. On hot days you'll see an intense heat in front of you in the form of lots and lots of orange sunlight and heat waves in the distance. The sunsets and sunrises during hot times are absolutely blinding!</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>I usually complain that many single player games these days do not have much in the way of 'replayability'. That is one aspect where San Andreas sets the bar so ridiculously high, that I can't imagine any non-GTA games coming anywhere near it for years to come.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Freedom has always been the GTA hallmark, and in that regard, San Andreas piles on the features to ludicrous proportions. Comparing San Andreas to any other game is like comparing King Kong to the other monkeys; it is the Overgame.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>There really is no other game like it, despite there being many imitators, and this is precisely the kind of experience that reminds why, exactly, we play games: to be liberated from the constraints of reality, and explore living, breathing worlds. Few games have come this close to realizing that promise.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Once again, Rockstar Games and Rockstar North have changed gaming as we know it...The variety of missions in San Andreas is staggering, as there's literally hundreds of varied tasks that will help you gain respect.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Despite minor flaws, this is by far the most enjoyable game in the GTA series, and will eat well over 100 hours of your time.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>100</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>The word “massive” doesn’t begin to describe the entire state of San Andreas and exploring it without any load times is like the cherry on top of an overly sweetened cake.  Driving has been tightened to perfection and the changes to the targeting system makes popping caps on fools so much better.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>99</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>It's about being in one long and deeply worthwhile experience that manages to do the impossible and improve on what has gone before, and then has the confidence to expand itself to a size that defies belief.

It is the best hands-down. No other game can come even close to this one...The possibilities of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas are endless.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>98</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>A stunning achievement for both Rockstar and Sony. It shows just how powerful the PS2 system is when used right. This game has the potential to last months and months on end, especially for the 100% target.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>98</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>The story to San Andreas is by far the best of any GTA game to date. As you progress, you will experience turning points to this story that drive you to see the next cutscene, something that has never been done in a GTA game before.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>98</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>The game’s targeting system has been improved and is very reminiscent of the developer’s 'Manhunt,' which overall makes it more cohesive. The game allows you to get better with guns and you’ll have different phases, which will give you more control over your shooting abilities.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>97</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>While I can't say that GTA: San Andreas is another revolution in gaming like GTA3 was, it is an evolution that goes light years beyond what we saw with the last two titles in the series.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>97</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Only the graphical bugs, slow-down and other nit picks associated with the fact that the game is pushing the aging PS2 to its limits keeps this from being the first perfect entry into the series.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>97</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Thanks to the sheer level of detail and the amount of gameplay you'll be able to engage in during C.J.'s adventures, San Andreas surpasses just about any game that’s come along in the PS2’s history.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>97</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>The amount of attributes that you can actually improve is staggering. CJ must learn how to drive, shoot, swim, workout, be healthy, sprint and participate in relationships.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>96</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>With its strong story, well-written dialogue, terrific voice cast, impressive graphics, great in-game sound, and extremely entertaining and varied gameplay, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a stupendous thrill ride that shouldn't be missed.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>96</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>This could very well be remembered as the PlayStation 2's best game ever.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>96</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>As far as actual content goes, I don’t think there’s been a game in history with more, so you almost need to own this game just so you can see how packed a game can be.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>96</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>When you take the scope of the entire game into considerations, San Andreas is a real technical feat.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>96</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>It is hard to find a game with the perfect blend of unique, action packed missions and interesting and enthralling non-mission events, but Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas pulls it off in convincing fashion.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>96</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>There's so much to do in this game that it's outside of my range of imagination to be able to picture me reaching a 100% complete. Unfathomable.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>95</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>The second you start playing this game you realise that the latest Rockstar title is about a hundred times more complex than its predecessors. Not only is there a load of new weapons, cars and a huge new environment available, but the gaming experience itself has completely evolved.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>95</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>It is, in my opinion, the best single player experience available right now.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>95</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>A weaker soundtrack and nagging problems with the interface take the game down just shy of getting a full 10, but this is the digital embodiment of a killer app.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>95</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Calling this game huge is an understatement...All told, San Andreas is about four times the size of any previous GTA game.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>95</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>This is arguably the most important videogame this year - yes, even more important than 'Halo 2' - not only because it's a superbly crafted videogame, but because it's also a bona fide sociological artifact, one that manages to effectively evoke a specific time and place in American history—in this case, a hot and hazy California during the nascent days of hip-hop culture.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>95</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>The minor control problems, reoccurring graphical bugs, and the generally similar core gameplay as before keep the game's score down a tad from what it could be, but the ridiculous amount of content and pure value available here is second to none. It doesn’t completely redefine the series.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>94</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>A masterful blend of storyline, exciting action, and freeform gameplay that will keep you hooked for hours on end.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>94</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>There is personality and atmosphere everywhere in this game and even small things such as the body language of pedestrians sets the scene in every neighbourhood you visit.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>94</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Surprisingly easy to pick up, and startlingly difficult to master, San Andreas offers the most complete gaming package ever made on the current generation of consoles.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>92</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>No one should deny that San Andreas is a great storytelling game. It's just that, between gradually caring less and less about the main characters, and performing many game actions that are nearly identical to those of previous titles in the series, San Andreas could easily begin to wear a bit thin.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>92</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>This game has so many new innovations that it leaves its predecessors in the dust.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>92</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>My biggest beef with San Andreas is the implementation of the gang warfare system...It takes away a certain element that was found in the earlier games, that of the feeling that you were running an entire city.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>92</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is to the gaming world what 'The Matrix' was to the film industry: it breaks so much ground and introduces so many significant things that it will no doubt have an impact on how games are made for a long time to come.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>92</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>GTA may be looking its age and some of its more favoured structural ideas are beginning to feel a little dated, but Rockstar continue to revel in the mastery of presenting a consuming environment to the player and inviting them to do within it what they wish.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>91</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>San Andreas's chief advantage over 'Vice City' is size. And for many players, that's good enough. But another group of fans will come to quietly understand that, at least for the time being, 'Vice City' remains the high point of the GTA series.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>90</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>The fact that you can do whatever you want, gunning down rival gang members, impressing the girls, robbing the rich, breaking into the Army Depot, whether it is flying a plane, or pimping out your car, playing some pool, riding across country, the game play is endless.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>90</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>As with previous GTA games there's lots to criticise, but San Andreas survives, scathed but still walking tall, buoyed by the kind of ambition that sees most games crumble under the weight of it all. It's a multi-faceted, multi-achieving experience, a rough-edged but massively substantial landmark. [Christmas 2004, p.78]</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>90</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>I have to subtract a point for what, in my opinion, is a total lack of overall upgrading. While there are hundreds of more things to do in San Andreas, I feel, in my heart of hearts, that the game looks and plays just like its two predecessors.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>90</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>One of the game's biggest achievements, however, is that it actually gets you to care about Carl and his friends - the other gang members who ride and fight with you on most missions. They all seem to have their own personalities and come across as being fully-realized characters.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>90</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>There is also a distinct lack of overall polish, mostly noticeable in the smallest ways: ugly character models, cluttered maps (the custom waypoint is a welcomed and downright necessary addition), unnecessarily complex wardrobe management, odd misspellings ('Cobra Marital Arts'), and even repeated references to Los Angeles instead of Los Santos.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>90</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>San Andreas' greatest success is that it gives us more space for our imaginations than most other games do, and ties together the edges neatly with a well-crafted story and missions, adding up to a whole that few games can compare to.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>90</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>San Andreas is a true epic, but no game should be this frustrating.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>90</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>The seamless way in which the DJs react to the in-game environment, and from an intertextual standpoint, merge better with the player's situation far more effectively than in the previous games is just inspiring.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</td><td>playstation-2</td><td>90</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Enormous, diverse, engrossing, daring, liberating, sophisticated and -- most of all -- ambitious.

It takes a template laid down by its predecessors and expands upon it, improving on and streamlining some of its rougher aspects.

I never felt like I didn’t have something to do and as of right now, I’m going right back in to do it all over again.

The only remaining question is: Where will – or can –the series go from here?

If all the other studious could do what Rockstar can, there'd be plenty of life left in the current console generation. But that's the thing, isn't it. No other developer is like Rockstar. And no other series is like Grand Theft Auto.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>GTA V represents the videogame at its finest.

It's not just the world. It's the gargantuan story, the sheer amount of missions and the variety introduced with them, the activities to take part in, or the secrets waiting to be unveiled. It's a highlight of the generation.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>It features arguably the best story of the series that’s greatly enhanced by the added dynamic of three contrasting protagonists.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>From skydiving and submarine exploration to bounty-hunting and watching animated shorts, GTA V is absolutely crammed full of things to do, and it looks amazing while you do them.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Rockstar's Xbox 360 swansong is probably the console's greatest technical achievement, and as such it's unmissable.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Is Grand Theft Auto V the best game of the year? Easily. Is it the best game of this current generation of consoles? Definitely – and it’s quite possibly the best video game yet. I say this after playing it for “only” 20 hours.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>No one makes worlds like Rockstar, but at last it has produced one without compromise. Everything works. It has mechanics good enough to anchor games of their own, and a story that is not only what GTA has always wanted to tell but also fits the way people have always played it. It’s a remarkable achievement, a peerless marriage of world design, storytelling and mechanics that pushes these ageing consoles to the limit and makes it all look easy.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best sandboxes that video games have to offer. Where massive worlds often are plagued by boring missions and lifeless areas, Rockstar has managed to make an incredibly engaging game that still retains a humongous and lively world.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>The writing associated with those main characters and their stories is the best part of Grand Theft Auto V.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>There’s no better time than this to use the word masterwork: Rockstar did a colossal job creating a huge, visually stunning world chiseled in its finest details, populated by brilliant characters and with highly spectacular and varied gameplay.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>No game can match its mix of scale, direction and quality - and we don't know when one might.

Beyond the game’s story line you’ll be able to put in hundreds of hours just wandering the city streets and never be bored doing so.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>99</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Rockstar Games has managed to exceed my expectations and create one of the best games of this generation.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>98</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Theft Auto 5 defines what we want out of a free-roam action game. It also outshines all of its predecessors in every possible way, because it perfects the familiar formula and takes it to new heights.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>98</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>For the anarchist, GTA5 is quite a playground. The entire map is available once you get through an hour or so of the story, and the tools of destruction are numerous and hugely enjoyable, although some of them might need to be unlocked first. The Gatling gun returns and a gas canister spills a solid line of flammable justice waiting to be set off. Guns can be painted up and modded with flashlights, grips, scopes, and suppressors.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>98</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>The standout factor for Grand Theft Auto V is that each character not only offers a unique perspective on the GTA world in which you’re taking part, but on gaming as a whole. Franklin is new to the ‘game’ -- he looks sharp and listens and learns. Michael is as I’ve painted him to be: a reluctant master in an ever-changing dojo clinging to a wall of arbitrary yet important-to-him trophies, while Trevor is the wild side in every gamer (thanks Joab) -- the sort of yes-man we inevitably become because pain and reward exist on a blurred precipice in modern narrative-driven gaming.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>98</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>The narrative fails to match the impact John Marston or Niko Bellic's tales, but the colorful characters kept me interested in the story nonetheless.

In fact, it's one of the best of this generation. [Oct 2013]</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>95</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>I can’t imagine the pressure behind the scenes, but everything that Rockstar has attempted with Grand Theft Auto V gels together perfectly. As we look forward to the next-generation launches in just a few months, it’s pretty awesome to see the best game of this entire generation cap it off.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>95</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Rockstar has expanded and improved upon so much of what's special about video games as mainstream spectacles, from the playful use of characters to the refined take on world design. The developer's progress makes the aspects of the game left in cultural stasis — the poorly drawn women, the empty cynicism, the unnecessarily excessive cruelty — especially agitating.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>95</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>The most amazing thing about this criminal saga is not only its scale, but that it perfectly works on several levels. Spine-tingling driving, fun missions, excellent dialogue, fully fleshed characters, vicious satire on pretty much everything… One play-through is not enough to appreciate GTA 5 in all its multi-layered glory.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>94</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Its problems range from finicky little things like twitchy helicopter flying controls to much larger issues, such as unsettling bits of cruelty that don’t always register as satire, or the still-unsolved challenge of maintaining any sense of plot urgency in a game where players are free to abandon the storyline and spend hours skyjacking blimps, tooling around in a submarine or taking in-game smartphone selfies and posting them online.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Despite all these accomplishments and additions though, GTA V isn’t a huge leap forward for Rockstar. Instead, it’s an evolution of all their previous work, all combined into one sandbox experience on a massive scale. But it’s a satisfying path that the franchise has taken, kicking other genre games off the throne that it helped build.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Although it does suffer from a few problems that have plagued the franchise since the beginning, the improved driving controls, captivating leads, and the sprawling city of Los Santos should win the hearts of any open world fan out there.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>An ambitious game, attempting to meld three very different characters together to tell one encompassing story of survival in what amounts to the worst place in America. That story stumbles, but the open-ended gameplay remains a showpiece for the vast amount of content that can be poured into a virtual world.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>All three characters, in their respective ways, feel representative of the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole, and contribute to making GTA V what it is -- the ultimate culmination of Rockstar's beloved and despised series.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>When you’re dealing with disturbing subjects ranging from life-destroying drug addiction to creepy cult organizations to legitimately psychopathic behaviour, the jokes go down a little easier if you get the sense that the writers penned their quips with an aim to make you think about why you’re laughing...True satire happens in Grand Theft Auto V, just not nearly as often as I’d like.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>85</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Theft Auto V offers one of the best sandbox experiences ever,</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>80</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Even with as many downs as ups, Grand Theft Auto V is still a significant achievement in design. Playing missions from multiple perspectives is a creative spark that will surely light up the next generation, and I'm confident the Housers have even bigger ambitions. They'll keep building upon this template and inch tantalizingly closer to creating their perfect game. GTA5 isn't it, but its flashes of brilliance will endure.</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>80</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>One immaculate game.

It boasts better balancing and takes into account the supportive players more than ever compared to the regular solo guns blazing hero. Quite comprehensive, it also re-introduces the beloved Spec Ops mode, and the launch of Call of Duty Elite grants him the best available service in that category. Even though in terms of production values, and scope of the competitive multiplayer, Battlefield 3 harms Activision's champion, it remains a title that is firmly anchored to its traditional strengths, and doesn't get lazy. The lovers will be ecstatic, the haters gonna hate.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>The Infinity Ward engine is far from cutting edge – the overall look of the game has not moved on enormously since MW2. But the vision, the choreography, the sense of scale and detail – they are awe-inspiring at times.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>100</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 is a shining example of refinement and improvement. It's familiar, sure, but here familiarity doesn't breed contempt, just respect and reward for those who've dedicated so much time to the series.

It has a solid, single-player campaign (which is long enough if played correctly but feel free to complain if you want); a feature-rich multiplayer mode that has new modes and will be played by millions of gamers for years to come; a great Spec-Ops mode that includes an all-new Survival gameplay mode; and is the first Call of Duty title to launch with the new Elite service, something that will become a standard in the CoD franchise for years to come.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>98</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, Infinity Ward (what's left of the original gang) and Sledgehammer Games have stayed loyal to the Call of Duty and Modern Warfare brand in the name of all their loyal fans.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>96</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Familiar-yet-new territory comes in the form of AC-130 missions, only these are far more robust, and desperate. You're clearing a path on-the-fly for teams on the ground, but equally switching between the two. And it's not just decimating ground forces, either. There's no arguing Infinity Ward make a chopper crash look the best in the biz, and you'll be swatting enemy helicopters from the sky like so many flies under your fly-swatter. </td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>96</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Looking back over this generation, it can be argued that Modern Warfare reinvented the way we play shooters, and now, Modern Warfare 3 may have come as close as we'll ever get to perfecting it. What few complaints we do have feel negligible in comparison to everything the game does right, and both the campaign and multiplayer components deliver on all fronts. If you've always been hesitant to try Call of Duty, this might be the time to jump in. It honestly doesn't get much better than this.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>95</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>The multiplayer is the strongest it has ever been, and the coop mode has been expanded from an addition to a full-fledged mode. Modern Warfare 3 won't blow away anyone looking for anything new, but it will deliver enough thrills and quality to keep players engaged and coming back for more.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>95</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>The multiplayer is a cut above the rest, with a ton of options and the ability to customize a huge number of details on any of the maps you set up for Private Matches.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>95</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 succeeds in every area and the development teams at both Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games should be extremely proud. </td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>95</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>One startlingly huge, polished, and downright entertaining shooter experience. Sure, we can come up with a list of things we'd love to see from the series - whether it's a revamped campaign approach or a revitalized game engine and aesthetic - but when everything here is this well-executed and offers so many enduring thrills, it's hard to knock it too much. MW3 absolutely delivers.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>95</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 treads familiar ground and focuses on tweaking rather than reinventing, and that's just fine. While there are no major revelations or surprises, this is still a gorgeously produced package that gives military shooter fans exactly what they want. There's a reason why Call of Duty is the most powerful videogame franchise of the modern era, and Modern Warfare 3 serves as a reminder -- it's just that damn good at what it does.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>95</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 really is the best multiplayer shooter on console right now. It's not changing the landscape of shooters - it's honing it to its sharpest point. It's a no-brainer purchase for console gamers.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>95</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 is the elite of the elite shooters.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>94</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Big, brash, ballsy, bombastic, barmy and bloody.

With almost 20 modes available there's something for just about everyone.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>93</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a completely crazy tour-de-force that carries you through trenches all around the world, as well as giving a great refresh to the multiplayer mode that has all but defined Activision in the console market.  </td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>92</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 is what the fans expected - fast paced multiplayer action with some new twists and game modes that are a definitely a fresh breeze. But there are also a great campaign and the usual challenging Spec Ops.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>92</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>The biggest problem with Modern Warfare 3 is that it doesn't surprise, aside from the fact that there's more for the solo player to do than you might expect. It feels very safe, which is understandable given the budget and its sales expectations-as well as the rabid fan base that doesn't necessarily want innovation. </td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>91</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>What it does do so well is take a perfectly honed formula and make it even more flexible to gamers' grips, without disturbing the game's core experience. It's a balancing act, and I don't think any gaming developer in their right mind would attempt to make an entirely new package here.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>91</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>While the first two Modern Warfares proved to be the extraordinary work of a single, incredibly talented team, the third instalment in the series stands as a manifesto to what three great teams, working together as one passionate unit, can achieve. It's an improvement over its predecessor in pretty much every aspect and a return to former strength after the stagnation that was MW 2. Sledgehammer and Infinity Ward deliver a natural conclusion to an astounding trilogy - and the best Call of duty since the first Modern Warfare.  </td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>91</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>I'm glad to say the multiplayer remains addicting and is more balanced than ever.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>91</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Following in its predecessors footsteps, MW3 once again offers a great piece of entertainment. The campaign is short as usual, yet well-crafted, especially for the urban environments. Spec Ops, both Missions and Survivals, are a lot of fun, but the true heart of it all is in the competitive multiplayer. New modes and rebalanced perks and streaks add some teamwork-oriented action, and the overall experience is rich and entertaining as usual. It lacks in innovation, but it's still the best shooter on HD consoles.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>91</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>A refinement of the series that further evidences why, year after year, Activision puts it on a pedestal. If you enjoy shooters, you owe it to yourself to at least give Modern Warfare a chance. If you've been on the fence because of the die-hards, this is the year to dip your toe in the water.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>It delivers everything that you expect from a Call of Duty release, and it does that very well. The campaign strikes a perfect chord and there's not a single dull mission in the bunch, every minute filled with bravado and bravery as it steadily rises toward a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. </td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>It's not often that a game franchise can be this good on such a consistent basis, but the Modern Warfare series continues to impress thanks in large part to its stellar story and highly-replayable multiplayer components.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Much like its predecessors in many ways, but bigger and more varied. The multiplayer mode got new kill streaks, new objectives and an extreme number of unlockable content. Add a solid (but almost to intensive) campaign, a survival mode and the spec ops missions and you got a seriously great game. </td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 is the best package of it's kind on consoles and instead of going stale it continues to impress.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 is a great FPS and a satisfying ending to Infinity's trilogy. With an adrenalinic and spectacular campaign and very entertaining multiplayer modes, fans of the series won't be disappointed – though we would have liked if the developers pushed it more on the technical side.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Much like its predecessors: a bombastic but brief single player campaign coupled with laser-focused multiplayer.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>This is probably the best Modern Warfare ever published. The campaign is</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Despite feeling some fatigue with the reuse of this same formula repeatedly, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 still winds up being everything I expected, and it even includes a few extra additions and improvements I didn't expect. </td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Everything fans may expect. A frantic and incredibly fun multiplayer with tons of options, game modes and unlockables, and also very well polished, and an intense campaign that concludes a story which started with Modern Warfare four years ago. The formula is aging - although it works as well as ever, its visuals are stagnating, but this is still a must-have for those looking for direct action.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>In a single-player campaign that goes a bit over-the-top at times, it's a relief to see that the action is scaled-back with Soap and Price often enough to ensure that these characters receive the billing they deserve. Elsewhere in the multiplayer, Infinity Ward was always going to have a hard time replicating the impact of its package from two years ago but it's managed a rock-solid, if slightly conservative offering for this difficult third album in the Modern Warfare series.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>If you're looking for a new kind of shooter, look elsewhere. Modern Warfare 3 succeeds by doing more – much, much, much more – of what's always worked spectacularly for the series. We still can't get enough.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Gameplay-wise, it's essentially the same game; that is, the best online FPS, an exciting and frantic experience. It offers several game modes, new weapons and balances the perks. Also, the competitive and the cooperative experience in Spec Ops and Survival has been greatly improved. And it has the best campaign yet in a Modern Warfare game. Another headshot from Infinity Ward.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>As substantial as they are the changes won't silence committed critics, but for accessible, content-rich action this is still the best first person shooter of the year.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 doesn't do anything new, but it also doesn't do anything wrong. For better or worse, this is a slick and well-metered trio of modes that make an entertaining package, but Sledgehammer Games and Infinity Ward are simply looking to augment previous games rather than expand the series into pastures new.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare has always relied on smoke and mirrors. What surprises us is how ably the conjurers perform despite the much publicised Infinity Ward departures. After many months of doom-mongering it's great to find a game as confident and capable as those that preceded it.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 is a solid FPS. If you didn't like the previous chapters, you won't change your mind, since the game doesn't change its formula. Scripted, spectacular and short, the single player campaign is just an appetizer, leading you to taste the savory multiplayer and the amazing Spec-Ops missions.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer is some of the series' strongest, and the co-op offerings have been expanded tenfold. But the campaign will leave you yearning, wishing that the characters were differentiated by more than thick accents, or that the gameplay tried something more than aim, shoot, take cover, reload, rinse and repeat.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Without question a better game than the previous three CoD games and easily the most spectacular in the series.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>The multiplayer is hands-down the best it has ever been, with more features, more modes and a ton of new levels and ways to interact via Call of Duty Elite. The singleplayer campaign and Spec Ops mode add value to the overall package, creating something that may not be perfect, but is too damn addicting to pass up.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>An emphatic, feature-packed and sometimes stunning final act.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 meets expectations. The core elements of multiplayer and the campaign remain fundamentally unchanged, but the game serves as a great example of how many subtle tweaks can add up to an improved overall product.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>90</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>I never expected Modern Warfare 3 to go toe-to-toe with EA's juggernaut this year, but it came out of the gates with a tour de force campaign and co-op mode. It loses points with a perhaps too-familiar multiplayer that caters to the juvenile on Xbox Live; though don't be mistaken, Modern Warfare 3 is one hell of a shooter and a highlight for a series that just won't die – no matter how much we wish it bloody would, at times.</td><td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>xbox-360</td><td>88</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Modern Warfare 3 is a solid entry into the series. The singleplayer campaign offers non-stop action to the point of excess, while the multiplayer offers the usual hooks and unlockables that will keep you busy for weeks to come.
